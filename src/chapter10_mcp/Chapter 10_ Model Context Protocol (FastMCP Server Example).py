# Converted from: Chapter 10_ Model Context Protocol (FastMCP Server Example).ipynb
# fastmcp_server.py
# This script demonstrates how to create a simple MCP server using FastMCP.
# It exposes a single tool that generates a greeting.

# To run this server:
# 1. Make sure you have FastMCP installed: pip install fastmcp
# 2. Save this code as fastmcp_server.py
# 3. Run from your terminal: python fastmcp_server.py

from fastmcp import FastMCP, tool
import asyncio # Required for FastMCP's async capabilities

# Define a simple tool function.
# The `@tool()` decorator registers this Python function as an MCP tool.
# The docstring becomes the tool's description for the LLM.
@tool()
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """
    Generates a personalized greeting.

    Args:
        name: The name of the person to greet.

    Returns:
        A greeting string.
    """
    return f"Hello, {name}! Nice to meet you."

# Initialize the FastMCP server.
# By default, FastMCP runs on http://localhost:8000
# and automatically discovers functions decorated with @tool().
mcp_server = FastMCP()

# To run the server, you typically use `mcp_server.run()` or `mcp_server.run_async()`.
# For a simple script, `run()` is sufficient.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Starting FastMCP server...")
    print("This server exposes a 'greet' tool.")
    print("Access the tool schema at http://localhost:8000/tools.json")
    print("Press Ctrl+C to stop the server.")
    # FastMCP's run() method is blocking and starts the server.
    # It handles the asyncio event loop internally.
    mcp_server.run()
