# 2. Refactor the ImageGeneratorAgent into an LlmAgent.
# It now correctly uses the input passed to it.
image_generator_agent = LlmAgent(

    description="Generates an image based on a detailed text prompt.",
    instruction=(
        "You are an image generation specialist. Your task is to take the user's request "

        "After the tool returns the image bytes, you MUST output the image."

# 3. Wrap the corrected agent in an AgentTool.
# The description here is what the parent agent sees.
image_tool = agent_tool.AgentTool(

artist_agent = LlmAgent(

        "Then, use the `ImageGen` tool to generate the image using your prompt."
    ),
    tools=[image_tool]
)

# --- How it works now ---
# 1. The `artist_agent` decides on a prompt, e.g., "A photorealistic cat wearing a tiny top hat."
# 2. It calls the tool: `ImageGen(input="A photorealistic cat wearing a tiny top hat.")`
#    (Note: AgentTool uses 'input' as the default parameter name for the sub-agent's query).
# 3. The `agent_tool` invokes `image_generator_agent` with the prompt as its input.
# 4. The `image_generator_agent` follows its instructions and calls `generate_image(prompt="...")`.
# 5. The function returns the image bytes.
# 6. `image_generator_agent` returns the final image as its result.
# 7. `artist_agent` receives the image result from the tool call.
