# Converted from: Chapter 7_ Multi-Agent Collaboration - Code Example (ADK + Gemini Parallel).ipynb
from google.adk.agents import Agent, ParallelAgent

# It's better to define the fetching logic as tools for the agents
# For simplicity in this example, we'll embed the logic in the agent's instruction.
# In a real-world scenario, you would use tools.

# Define the individual agents that will run in parallel
weather_fetcher = Agent(
    name="weather_fetcher",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
    instruction="Fetch the weather for the given location and return only the weather report.",
    output_key="weather_data"  # The result will be stored in session.state["weather_data"]
)

news_fetcher = Agent(
    name="news_fetcher",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
    instruction="Fetch the top news story for the given topic and return only that story.",
    output_key="news_data"      # The result will be stored in session.state["news_data"]
)

# Create the ParallelAgent to orchestrate the sub-agents
data_gatherer = ParallelAgent(
    name="data_gatherer",
    sub_agents=[
        weather_fetcher,
        news_fetcher
    ]
)

# To run this, you would use the ADK's Runner, which manages state and execution.
# The following is a conceptual example of how it would be invoked.

# from google.adk.runners import Runner
# from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService

# # Setup runner and session
# runner = Runner(agent=data_gatherer, session_service=InMemorySessionService())

# # Execute the agent
# async for event in runner.run_async(
#     new_message="Get weather for Mountain View and news on technology"
# ):
#     if event.is_final_response():
#         # The results are now in the session state
#         final_state = runner.get_session().state
#         print("\n--- Gathered Data ---")
#         print(f"Weather: {final_state.get('weather_data')}")
#         print(f"News: {final_state.get('news_data')}")
